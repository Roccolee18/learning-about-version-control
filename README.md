# \# Learning about Version Control



Author: Rocco Lee

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!



I like the fact that all files are automatically backed up through version control so rollbacks can be done in case of emergencies.



I don't like the fact that it is a bit unintuitive for a non-technical user to start learning about version control, as it can be intimidating for new users.
